ðŸ“˜ CCNA Practical Labs â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer
This repository contains practical lab exercises and network simulations I completed as part of my CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) training using Cisco Packet Tracer. 
The labs cover a range of networking concepts including:

   Basic Router and Switch Configuration
   VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing
   Static and Dynamic Routing (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP)
   Access Control Lists (ACLs)
   DHCP and NAT Configuration
   Network Topologies and Troubleshooting

These files are intended for learning and reference purposes. Each .pkt file represents a practical scenario designed to reinforce core networking concepts aligned with the CCNA certification syllabus.
